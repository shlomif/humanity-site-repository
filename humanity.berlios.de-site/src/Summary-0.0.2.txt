Prologue:
=========

Earth - the initial frontier. Somewhere in the depths of space, on a remote
planet you know as Earth, came up a relatively unique phenomenon: Civlization.
What it means is that intelligent:
[ A text on the screen with a beep ] - (?)
conscious
[ A text on the screen with the same beep] - (?)
Stop it!
[ A text on the screen with a different beep] - (!)
Like I said, intelligent, conscious people formed cities and countries, with
a technology that became more and more advanced in time.

In this motion picture, we will take a typical city of this civilization in its beginning, and examine its dominant elements.

[While that, the Earth comes to focus somewhere around Palestine and the
Eastern Jordan Side].


The Cathedral:
==============

[ An Altar is shown with a priest standing near by and several people
  around him bringing goats, sheep, etc. ]

The Priest: Next, next, who's next?

Man: I am.

The Priest: Hey Joseph! You've been here last... two weeks ago, right?

Joseph: right!

The Priest: OK. Tell me what you've been up to until then?

Joseph: Well, I did a lot of good deeds: I helped my friends, taught my
children a few things... the works.

The Priest: Excellent. Did you do anything that could have appeased any of the
Gods?

Joseph: Well, I lied.

The Priest: What for?

Joseph: To protect a friend.

The Priest: Well, the god of Honesty is mad at you and the god of friendship
likes you. They will sort it out between the two of them.

Joseph: I also broke a pot my wife prepared. A very nice pot, by the way.

The Priest: That's not good - you have made both the goddess of pottery and
the goddess of marriage a little angry. You did not do it on purpose?

Joseph: No.

The Priest: OK. I'd say we can take two legs of the sheep you brought each for
the gods. And we'll take the rest for the rest of the Gods and for eating. By
the way, [Loudly] everyone should know that four days from now, I'm going to
hold the festival of all the minor Gods that no-one ever remembers. I'm going
to read the list of all the 2100 of them as the central event of it.

The Crowd: "No, forget it!" "No Way I'm going to attend that!", etc.

The Priest: OK. I can have 10 people each read 210 entries.

A person from the crowd: How about 20?

The Priest: Super. Like I said, 20 people will each read 105 entries, so be
there.

The Bazaar:
===========

A typical Semitic market with lots of comotion. Eventually the camera focuses
on a salesman trying to sale a very large fish, for the price of two shekels.
[ this is too much money - we need a more reasonable price]

Eventually, there comes a loud sound of drumming and percussion instruments,
and a singer appears in the clearance, and starts singing, while waving a
medium fish:

"Buy the fish,
Buy the fish,
Who wants to buy the fish,
Buy the fish,
Buy the fish,
Buy the fish now."

"Buy the fish,
Buy the fish,
Who wants to buy the fish,
Buy the fish,
Buy the fish,
Buy the fish now."

[Shouts from the crowd:] "3 Shekels", "4 Shekels". He continues:

[ Cut to the original fish monger, he looks amazed ]

"If you wanna prepare a dish,
you have got to buy the fish,
so everybody, save your keesh,
Everybody - buy the fish!"

[Shouts from the crowd:] "5 Shekels", "6 Shekels".

The Singer says: "Sold for 6 shekels."

Eventually the comotion clears up, and the fish monger with the large fish,
starts to shout again: "One large fish! Two shekels!"


The Well:
=========

The Wall:
=========
The Wall Exists, therefore Existence Exists.

The Gate:
=========

Guard: "You are a son of Emor, who was Ham's child, therefore I hate
your guts."

Merchant: "No, you are a son of Gileg, who was Ham's child, therefore I hate
your guts."

Start to fight it.

Guard raises his hand: "Tell you what, let's settle it by saying that I hate
you and you hate me?"

Merchant: "But we are cool, right?"

Guard: "Sure!"

An Egyptian Merchant comes by.

Egyptian Merchant: "I could not help but hear your conversation. If I
had accepted this Semite family tree, I would have to say that Ham was the
most noble son of Noah".

[The other two look puzzled]

Merchant: "So you hate both of us and both of us hate you?"

Egyptian: "That's right!"

Merchant: "But we're cool?"

Egyptian: "We're cool."


The River:
==========

The Storage:
============

The Town Council (the final episode):
=====================================

City Head: OK. Here we are for our monthly town counsil. Is anything on
the agenda?



Epilogue:
=========

Rehearse of part of the "Buy the Fish" scene only in 2-D and with better music.
Eventually, the camera zooms out to view the MTV logo on a T.V. Screen just in
time to catch the fishmonger with the large fish. Then it says on the screen:

The Performer earned a double-platinum for his album "Songs of the Bazaar"
with the mega-hit single "Buy the Fish".

--

The Priest wrote an international best-seller which he titled the
"Altar-native way of investing in the stock exchange."

--

The inventor remained an inventor. He invented the "Supremium 6000",
the "Chuck-Chuckium 6000" and the "Semitici-tici-tacky 6000". All those
inventions made him a millionaire.
