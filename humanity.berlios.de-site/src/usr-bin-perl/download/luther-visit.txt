[ The Room Near the Reception. Michelle is working on one of the
workstations. Tony and Alan are at the back end ]

[ Luther enters, carrying a box. He is black and speaks in a heavy
southern excent. ]

Luther: Hi all! Michelle, I could swear you are becoming prettier with
every passing day.

Michelle: Luther! I am _so_ glad to see you. [They hug each other]

Michelle: So what did you bring this time?

Luther: I brought myself.

Michelle: Ohhhh!

Luther: And these chocolate chip cookies my wife prepared just for you.

Michelle: Goodie, let's put them on the counter.

[They go on talking, and meanwhile Tony and Alan are shown]

Alan: Who's he?

Tony: Luther Morrison. He's one of our biggest, and best, clients.

Alan: So he's alone is worse more than this entire company?

Tony: Something like that. Come on, I'll introduce you.

[Tony rises up. (Alan is already standing). They go ]

Tony: Hey Luther! Meet Alan, a new intern here.

Alan: Nice to meet you Mr. Morrison.

Luther: Nice to meet you too, son, but call me Luther from now on.

Alan: Luther. [they shake hands]

Luther: So what do you do, Alan, besides working here?

Alan: I'm studying in UCB in the vain hope of getting a degree in English.

Luther: A degree in English is a fine degree. Not only do you talk in 
English, but you _think_ in English too. And thinking is much more important
than talking. I think so, at least.

Where's Tim, Tanya and the rest of the gang?

Alan: Tim is in his office.
