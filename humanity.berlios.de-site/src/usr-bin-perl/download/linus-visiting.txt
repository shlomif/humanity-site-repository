[Linus Torvalds Enters. Applause]

Linus: Hello.

Tony: Hi! You are Linus Torvalds, right?

Linus: Yes.

Tony: Nice to meet you. They shake hands.

[Tony gets back to sitting next to the computer]

[Pause]

Linus [waits a little]: Isn't there something you want to ask me 
or say to me? The patch penguin fiasco? BitKeeper? The Dave Jones Tree?

Tony: Actually, there is one. [Turns to Linus] You're disturbing me.

Linus: I met Tony. He was not excited to meet me at all.

Tim: He gets this way. You should have seen the day that Sarah Michelle 
Gellar came to visit.

Linus: Let me guess - you host a "Buffy" fan site.

Tim: 5th place on Google, and it's of one of our employees.

Linus: Of Which one?

Tim: [shrugs] Of Tony of course. He is addicted to the show.

[Pause]

Linus: Now I'm puzzled.

Michelle: You see: he has this idea fix of not trusting people he does
not know personally or does not know people who know them personally, etc.
He has some distrust of media, and writing. You should ask him about what
happened to him in high school, and you'll understand where it came from.

Linus: What happened to him?

Michelle: I'm not telling you.
