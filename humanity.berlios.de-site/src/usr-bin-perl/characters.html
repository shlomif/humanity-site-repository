<h1>The Characters</h1>
<h3>Tim</h3>
<p>
The CEO of Simple-Site, Tim started it 5 years ago out of frustration
from the current state of the art in site design. He felt web designers
were spending too much time in kitchy site features which only added
to bandwidth instead of making simple sites that work.
</p>
<p>
Tim handles most of the marketing and some of the finances, but also
stays up to date with current developments. His machine is dual boot
Windows-Linux.
</p>
<h3>Robert</h3>
<p>
The CTO. Robert has been around the UNIX world for quite some time,
and still prefers the BSD way of doing things. He based his framework
mostly on Linux workstations and servers, because that's what "the kids
on the street are used to".
</p>
<p>
Robert has long hair with thick hear-strands, and a day-or-two beard.
Robert is often pictured sitting next to his workstation with a dim light
explaining something to another less experienced employee or telling
about his current projects, whether work related or otherwise.
</p>
<h3>Michelle</h3>
<p>
Michelle joined the company two years after its inception. Fresh out of
university, she discovered that she still had a lot to learn. Besides her
interest in computers, she also has an obsession with psychology, and buys
a lot of popular psychology books (or tells tim to have the company buy one).
</p>
<p>
She is an excellent human engineer, and knows how to navigate around people's
obsessions and idea fixes.
</p>
<h3>Paul</h3>
<p>
A system administrator/part time web designer, Paul likes to automate
everything in site. He never hides his hatred for everything Windows.
</p>
<h3>Tony</h3>
<p>
A private high-school graduate, Tony decided to work, before he enrolls
into a university ("to delay the inevitable as much as possible"). He possesses
a knowledge and understanding of computers that would not ashame most
CS graduates.
</p>
<p>
Tony likes to learn new languages and technologies and experience with them
a lot. He occasionally makes experiments for things he has to do for works
which tends to make everybody (especially Paul mad).
</p>
<h3>Tanya</h3>
<p>
Tanya is a second year EE student, who decided to get a diploma just so
workplaces would leave her alone. She preferred studying Electrical
Engineering, so she would at least learn more stuff that she did not
already know.
</p>
<p>
Tanya still learns a lot of stuff from the gang and from the Internet, but
is quite knowledgable to get by working on UNIX systems. She likes to get
involved in the open-source world (even though she has no dislike of
proprietary software), and already started and maintains a very active
project (TBD), has some other more minor ones, and contributes patches,
comments and "line-noise" to other projects.
</p>
<h3>Alan</h3>
<p>
Alan is a second year English student, who installed Linux on his home
computers, got hooked and decided to pursue this interest financially. He
is a rookie and makes a lot of first-time mistakes, but learns from them.
</p>
<p>
Alan has only recently joined the company.
