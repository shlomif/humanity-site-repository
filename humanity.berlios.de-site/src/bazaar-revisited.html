        <h1>The Bazaar Way of Making a Movie Revisited</h1>
        <p>
        It is helpful to actuall read Eric Raymond's 
        <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">"The
            Cathedral and the Bazaar"</a> before announcing a movie contacted
        in a Bazaar way so you'll know what Bazaar means... ;-)

        After I read it (it makes a very good read for everyone) I realized
        a few things. One was that even in most Bazaar-style projects there is
        still a core group of developers typically one or two that does most of
        the work. Few projects have more and they are typically very 
        important and mature.

        Secondly, that a Bazaar style movie may be something entirely 
        different. Its screenplay may be free as in free speach or not, but
        what's more important is how it is managed and makes use of the 
        Internet. For instance, after every scene is shot, it is edited, and
        an ad-hoc copy of the edited scene is placed on the web for everybody 
        to download. Furthermore, a Slashdot-like site is available for people
        to comment on the scene.

        The production team of the film will read this user input to understand
        what should be modified in the scene (if at all), and then take 
        measures to fix it. Eventually, close to final copies of the entire 
        film are placed online so people can watch them and revies them as
        well.

        It may actually produce on average motion pictures of higher quality 
        than what is done today. (in which a large part of the pictures that
        hit the silver screen are mediocre or junk). This is due to the large
        amount of peer review conducted within the film's production.

        This model probably will not work for T.V. shows where there's a tight
        schedule and new episodes have to be aired routinely. But it may 
        actually be very good for films.
