        <h1>Bazaar-style Movies Revisited</h1>
        <p>
        When I started the <a href="http://humanity.berlios.de/">Humanity 
            Movie</a> project of trying to make a movie <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">"Bazaar-style"</a>, 
        I missed something very essential about the Bazaar-model of 
        development. Namely, that it involved having a lot of peer input 
        and feedback as well as having a lot of peer involvement.
        </p>
        <p>
        It is helpful to actually read Eric S. Raymond's seminal work 
        <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">the 
            Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>, and <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">the 
            rest of the series</a> before starting such a project. If you 
        haven't read it already do, as it will make you fully understand
        what is a bazaar-style project and how to manage a project properly.
        </p>
        <p>
        The way I feel a Bazaar-style movie has to be managed is this, which
        is very different than the "Humanity" project.
        </p>
        <p>
        First of all, the screenplay writer or writers prepare a screenplay. It 
        doesn't have to be perfect, but it has to encompass the entire movie, 
        and prove that the movie is worthy of production. Afterwards, the script
        is posted online (preferably in a version control repository) for 
        everybody on the Internet to review and comment on.
        </p>
        <p>
        The screenplay writer's job now is to determine which comments are
        in place, which patches to accept, (yes! people will send 
        patches) and what changes to make. This will eventually make the 
        screenplay much better than it was at first.
        </p>
        <p>
        Next comes the actual filming (let's skip the casting - it's not
        that interesting). Every scene is filmed, and edited until the crew
        thinks it is good enough. It is then posted online, and people can 
        comment on it. If the director, based on the Internet surfers' 
        comments, believes the scene need to be re-edited or even 
        re-filmed, then the scene is would indeed be re-made.
        </p>
        <p>
        Of course, this can be done in a pipeline: several scenes will be
        filmed one after another, and while they are, the previous ones will
        be edited and placed online for inspection.
        </p>
        <p>
        After all that, it is iterated for the whole movie. The entire
        movie is glued together out of the individual scenes, placed online
        for people to watch (in an accessible multimedia format), and the
        film creator's get feedback on the entire film, and modify it 
        accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
        This method will probably increase the quality of the final film. 
        Another positive side-effect is that it will create a lot of fuss
        about it online and offline. By the time the film hits the silver
        screen, it will already have acquired a great deal of fans. Plus, 
        the movie can cover some of its expenses by allowing local fans
        to screen intermediate versions of it before its official debut.
        </p>
        <p>
        It's worth seeing if this method works by trying it several
        times. For this we need the cooperation of a film-maker. It is 
        naturally not a panacea, but it is a good way for film-makers to  
        harness the power of the Internet to their advantage, a good way for 
        Internet enthusiasts to influence the making of movies, and if 
        used correctly, a good way to increase the value of movies.
