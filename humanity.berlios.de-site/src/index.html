This page is old and probably not what you want. The 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/humanity/"><b>Humanity movie
screenplay</b></a> is now being hosted on 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish's site</a>.
</p>

<p>
For some of the conclusions from the project see 
<a href="bazaar-revisited.html"><b>The Bazaar Way of 
Making a Movie - Revisited</b></a>
</p>

</div>


<p>
Humanity is the bazaar way of writing a movie. The movie is split into
several scenes, each of which is mostly independant of the others. There
could be several alternatives scenes to each scene title, and each scene
can be rendered into several versions.
</p>

<p>
All the material will be released under the Open Publication License, and
will be registered to the "Humanity - the Cathedral, the Bazaar, the
rest..." Foundation.
</p>

<p>
"Humanity" is a parody about (you guessed it) humanity and especially about
modern life. It tells the story of a day in the life of a Semitic city circa
the year 500 B.C. through its elements: the Cathedral (actually an altar
with a priest), the Bazaar, the Well, the Wall, the Gate, the River, etc.

<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>

<h3>What if no-one will ever film a "Humanity" movie?</h3>

<p>
In case this happens, it still would not mean we have lost. We would
still have the fun and enjoyment of working on a funny, intelligent 
movie-script.
</p>

<p>
Besides, the Open Publication License allows individuals to freely use
the material we create in their own productions, so I don't think there
is a very big chance that there will never be an "implementation" of this
"code-base".
</p>

<h3>Is there any chance to earn money, by working on this film?</h3>

<p>
Not a big one, but nonetheless existent. While the script is free content, 
we can still give certification to the production of the "Humanity - The
Cathedral, The Bazaar, The Rest..." motion picture. While any entity may
produce a film like that and even call it "Humanity", we can always say that
we had nothing to do with it.
</p>

<p>
But if you expect a financial reward for your efforts, then I would
recommend you not to join in the first place.
</p>

<h3>Is the "bazaar" way of writing a film superior to the "cathedral" way
of writing a film?</h3>

<p>
I'm not implying that the "bazaar" way of writing a film is a superior
one, just that it is different and possible. I was told such a method
existed before, but I think "Humanity" is the first attempt to use the
Internet as a basis for collaboration.
</p>

<p>
Many films that were written in a "cathedral" style of way are actually
pretty good and sometimes very good. I'm just in the mood for trying
something different with "Humanity".
